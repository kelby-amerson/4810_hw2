Computer Graphics Project 2 - GUI of 2D objects


In this project, I made a user-friendly JavaFX GUI that takes in 2D object points and displays them on the GUI.
I also implemented transformation functions such as Translate, Scale, and Rotate.
The line drawing algorithm is also using the Bresenham Drawing algorithm that is displayed in Project 1
